# scraper

1. Heroku: I spent too much time on setting up Heroku and the mongoose db, but could not get it to work. 

2. Scraping: 
I spent too much time trying to scrape LA times website. Later, I switched over the NYT website. 

I tried using axios by following class activity 20 but could not get it to work.
